## Why I need this?

Ìf you have to make some (or many) signature to your Company workers, clients, etc... you can save
your time of repetitive tasks.

## How this help me? / How it works?

This will let to the end user to create him Signature using a simple `Web Form` (easy configuration).

You can create the signature filling form info and send a custom URL with all filled data (user can change it).

### There's more!

Imagine you change the custom signature and all users must change, in normal case you must generate it manually.

If you **save the link** sended to your end users, they will obtain again the updated signature!

## How can I configure?

1. Download the latest version from `master` (or clone repository).
2. Add your needed files (like images or documents) in `assets/`.
3. Duplicate `configurable_struct` to `configurable` folder and edit `configurable` folder files as your requirements.
4. Upload to any web server (necessary for `non-standalone` mode).

## What can I do when the script is working?

- Generate the signature (even without server in standalone mode)
- Generate a stand-alone signature:
  - IMAGES will be included in the HTML as base64
  - Signature will be greater size, but if signature server down, signature will work
- Send the signature link already generated (user only need to copy/paste signature)

**IMPORTANT:** Note that you must configure new images with corresponding functions for `standalone mode` 
and currently `standalone` **not** support documents on html.

## Why vanilla javascript?

Well, this is a simple script for fun. Angular or similar will be too bigger and "hard" for this simple script, and create a small "vanilla" app with only required dependences can be funny (but a bit harder to develop).

**The problem:** Currently most older browsers are not supported for pollifyll reasons (jQuery fix almost all).

### Why mustache?

This script must be easy to custom, and I have no enough time to create a full template parser.

### Why Bootstrap? (which includes jQuery)

Well, is design related problems, I prefer to use an already beautifull CSS to increase speed development.

Note that, even `Bootstrap` includes `jQuery`, is not used in app components (it can be added in the future as retro-compatibilty).
